# WeatherApp-Using-PostAPI
A WeatherApp built using a frontend (React.js) fetches real-time weather data by sending a POST request to a weather API (tested via Postman). The app allows users to input a city name, sends it to the API, and displays weather details such as temperature, humidity, and conditions.
